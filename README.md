[The Train-Scheduler]().  incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. The app will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. 



## Technology Utilized

      - The user will register and login to the website with a email and password.The Passport package will allow users to log in with username and password, or other third party verifications such as Google. The password hashing middleware which we use to compliment Passport’s functionality is the Bcrypt package. This tool allows us to save the user in the database to later compare with the password used when generating their authentication token. Bcrypt adds 'salt' onto this concept by adding extra random characters onto the password that gets hashed. So the resulting hash is always different for the same input password. This prevents people from building a dictionary of hashes that corespond to the password that made them.

      - Users will complete a form with their business information. Dealers will complete an application that will post to the common page. The dealers data will post to the common page on a card that the agents can view. The routes will allow both agents and dealers to view the common page. Agents can contact the dealers that post their information from the application form.
